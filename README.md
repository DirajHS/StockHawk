Stock Hawk is the third project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. 
</p>

## Getting started
Get the starter code for [Stock Hawk](https://github.com/udacity/StockHawk) here. This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the `gradlew build` command or use `Import Project` in Android Studio.

## User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
* Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do.
* We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely.
* Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time.
* I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen.
* I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes.
* When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date.


## Rubric

### Required components
* Each stock quote on the main screen is clickable and leads to a new screen which graphs the stockâ€™s value over time.
* Stock Hawk does not crash when a user searches for a non-existent stock.
* Stock Hawk Stocks can be displayed in a collection widget.
* Stock Hawk app has content descriptions for all buttons.
* Stock Hawk app supports layout mirroring using both the RTL attribute and the start/end tags.
* Strings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable tag marked to false.
* Stock Hawk displays a default text on screen when offline, to inform users that the list is empty or out of date.
